Back-end was done in MySQL Workbench. It includes triggers and stored procedures that should be run prior to connecting to the database application.

Front-end was done in the IntelliJ IDE for Java. The libraries that were used were java.sql.*, java.util.ArrayList, and java.util.Scanner). The program is connected to the database using the Java JDBC library.
